# Automated VAR

Automated video assistant referee; this repository automates some of the functionalities performed by [VAR](https://www.premierleague.com/VAR). The included functionalities include: 

1. Mistaken identity, i.e. the referee awards a yellow or red card to the wrong player. Automated VAR uses object tracking to ensure the correct player is disciplined.
2. Offside calls. Automated VAR checks if a player received the ball in an offside position. 

Examples of both functionalities are provided below.

## Requirements
